# 02456 Deep Learning - Group 68

### This repository contains code for training and evaluating feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) on the CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets without using torch libraries for deep learning. It includes functionalities for model saving and loading, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## Usage:

### It can be run from the notebook `notebook.ipynb`, which can run a training cycle or it can be used to run a saved model (recommended). The notebook reproduces the results from our best models.
